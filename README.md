## A Simple Flask WebApp For Studying

A really simple scalable WebApp project made for studying purposes.

Uses Blueprints and Templates for making the work with pages easier. Also it looks cool.

Redirects from the default / location to the Home page. Has navigation.

Uses url_for so as not to update the path to the files just in case.

Run this app by using the following command:
`python -m flask --app source run --port 8000`

It will be accessible at 127.0.0.1:8000.
