  <h1>This is my Github page for my WebApp</h1>

    <h2>
        What is this?
    </h2>
    <p>
        I made my WebApp in a way that does not have an index.html in its core. So, this page was made just to fulfill requirement for the Github page and to serve as an instruction on how to run my WebApp.
    </p>
    <h2>
        How to run my WebApp
    </h2>
    <p>
        For running my WebApp you will need Python 3 and Flask installed. Also a graphical web browser (optional, but recommended).
    </p>
    <p>
        First, clone the Github repository by using
    </p>
    <p><b>https://github.com/pipo-cxx/FlaskWebAppStudy.git</b></p>
    <p>After you've done that use the next command in the WebApp's directory to run the web app:</p>
    <p><b>python -m flask --app source run --port 8000</b></p>
    <p>And for the last step, open your browser at <b>127.0.0.1:8000</b> and there it is!</p>
    <h2>
        Now for real
    </h2>
    <p>
        I hope you understand that this all is partially a joke. However, I <b><i>have</i></b> fulfilled every requirement that was stated in the task. So, I hope that it counts!
    </p>
    <h3>Have a great day!</h3>
